Title: Don't let your vote go to waste!

Don’t let your vote go to waste!



Every spring, the student body of the University of Tartu elects new representatives into the Student Union, who bring with them fresh ideas and a thirst for action. There are many canditates, but you can play a role in who gets elected and who will represent you this coming academic year!
You can vote until April 30.

❗️Check out who applied in your institute and your faculty on UTSU’s homepage and give your vote in the online election environment❗️

 

The Student Union’s (UTSU) task is to stand for the students’ interests and needs and support them in protecting their rights. The union has more than 140 students from each institute and faculty, and their work is coordinated by the office and the board of UTSU.

 

The students are represented in every institute’s and faculty’s council, in the Senate, and every committee that influences student life. That means that the student representatives have an actual say in matters and an opportunity to advance life in the university. Every spring the student body of the University of Tartu elects new representatives, whose mandate lasts for one year. Additionally, the student councils will elect new representatives to UTSU's Monitoring Committee, to the UT Senate, and to the Federation of Estonian Student Unions (EÜS).
